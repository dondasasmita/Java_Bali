1. Write a program that copies a text file.In the process, have it convert all spaces into hyphens, use the byte stream file classes.
Use the traditional approach to closing a file by explicitly calling close().

2. Rewrite the program describe above so that it uses the character stream classes.
This time, use the try-with resources statement to automatically close the file.

3. Change the TickTock class so that it actually keeps time. That is, have each tick take one half-second, and each tock take one half second.
Thus, each tick-tock will take onbe second. (Don't worry about the time it takes to switch tasks, etc)

4. On your own, try adding synchronization to the Queue class developed in previoud chapters so that it is safe for multithread use.
