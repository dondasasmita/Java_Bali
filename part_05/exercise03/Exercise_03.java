/**
 * Write two classes. In Class_01 have a main method that creates on instance of Class_02. In Class_02, demonstrate
 * method overloading. You must overload a method a least 3 times. Each method should have a return type that is not
 * void. Within the main() (or a method of your choosing) in Class_01 call each overloaded method in Class_02.
 * Use System.out.println at various points to demonstrate the flow of execution. You can name these classes
 * whatever you want.
