write a multithreaded application that will do the following:
- use four threads to read four individual files (ie, file1, file2, fil3, file4)
- each thread is responsible for reading one file
- write the contents of all four files, in sequential order (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4) into file5 (edited) make sense?
(this will require the use of join() and synchronized())

if you'd like a different challenge just let me know

(this may also require a synchronized block, just FYI - this is a tricky one)

To do:
    1.create 4 files
    2.create a class that implements runnable
    3.each class will run a method that gets the file and read the file byte by byte.
      It will write into a new file.
